## Our understanding of the problem statement
- The problem statement focuses on the image based recognition of fish species and a rough estimation of their proportion when they are brought to the harbours as a harvest. 

- Since the main issue is with classification, so we came with an application which is integrated with a convolutional neural network based machine learning model in order to recognize a particular fish species.

- And to fulfil the demand of problem statement, our model also classifies fish species in different categories and estimating their market price.

## Our idea & approach
Keeping in view the feasibility, simplest platform should be developed keeping the accuracy as high as possible.
That turn out to be an Android App having Machine learning model ( CNN ) to ensure both.

## Motivation 
The major reason was the problems faced by fisherman in harbour, lack of awareness of market information, uncertain quality of fish, faulty measurement system. They do not have any specific way to have market information, places to sell the fishes etc. at just one click which result in huge loss.

## Economic feasibility
This complete implementation works on almost no cost from the user end. The user just need to download the app, capture the image and get details. Availability of android app is quite common and almost everyone has access to it now-a-days.
